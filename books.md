# Books – tech leadership (WIP)

## Basics

1. Go with a paper book
2. Work with the book (I usually use a pencil):

   1. Highlight what you find important.
   2. Makes notes, describe your own experience at the page corner.
   3. Do not hesitate to fold a page corner. 
   4. use stickers
3. Read the summary of the book later, you can use, for example, [NotebookML](https://notebooklm.google) to distill the concepts, think about what you have learned and what you should apply right away.

The **most powerful technique, read with your peer**:

1. Every week, you read one chapter.

2. You meet for 30-45 minutes.

3. The first and – then - second person goes page-by-page and share what they found important.

4. As each of you share, you both look for opportunities to discuss an insight, go deeper or relate the book content to what is happening in your work.
