## Engineering Lead Expectations (Notes)

5 aspects:

- Lead Business
- Lead Tech
- Lead Self
- Lead Team
- Lead People

Each of points is a start for a deeper discussion about the expectations - pick a topic:

- "Believe in yourself. You canâ€™t lead a cavalry charge if you think you look funny on a horse." [www.defmacro.org](https://www.defmacro.org/2014/10/03/engman.html)
- Taking care of your wellness, morale, satisfaction (aka nobody follows sb tired)
- Trust is the most valuable currency, keep your word, or say you will not do sth as soon as possible.
- Ambition -
- Solve problems in constrained environments
- **Engineering** Lead (short on: strong vs weak suits)
- Ying yang with PM, you both responsible for the product and its vision,
pull ahead or push back on the tech merit, both own the roadmap (yes and what should I do with other things)
- Reduce the complexity, interruptions, and uncertainty for your developers (no shielding)
- Repeat the **WHY** (vision), context of the work and its value.
- Provide the drum beat.
- Team:
  - Engage and include your teammates (the reserved one as well) in the discussion,
  - Help them to become better engineers, recognize their contribution,
  - Do tech decisions together (sometimes you need to call the shots),
  - Notice when they are stuck or when you over/under engineer,
  - It is where the work is done,
  - Morale, the team dynamics is your responsibility as well.

- You are the company for your directs (up/down communication, transparency, alignment),
- Lead by example == you do your work as a lead on 100% != you code like your devs (although it is  important to keep your tech skills sharp),
- Deadline, time commitments (ranges), pre-alpha, alpha, beta...communication about them,
- Delegate - the best place to be: when you are on holidays everything works good, the team does not grind to halt,
- Plus: use your 1on1 with your manager, experiment with your team, let me know when you help or just to discuss sth.
- [Speak up vs Shut Up](https://www.edbatista.com/2021/05/on-speaking-up-and-shutting-up.html), pick the battles - the higher you are the more important
