Proposed topics to cover, the initiative to take first up to new TL under a person who plays the role of coach and — mostly — rubber duck. 

Remember: strong vs. weak suits (see [excellence](https://www.edbatista.com/2012/01/high-performance-communication.html#excellence))

Not necessarily in the same order:

1. We are talking about five aspects ([src](https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_tech_leadership_WIP/blob/master/notes.md)):
    1. Lead Self
    2. Lead Individuals
    3. Lead Team
    4. Lead Tech
    5. Lead Business
      
2. Go through all reading/watching materials topics that the TL discuss with new joiner in the first months. Review the 7-30-60-90 and discuss it with your TL coach and your TL. Think about WHY, whether we could do sth better, different...

3. Go through chapters  of https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897 

   At every meeting, discuss 1 chapter:
  
   1. new TL should make notes, most effectively is to make notes directly on the paper copy,
   2. new TL shares what they found interesting, look for past experiences to confront them with the book,
   3. Rubber duck shares the story, trying to keep on the rubber duck's side most of the time.

4. Materials that we can discuss, we can go deeper into some of them, or signal topics that might be relevant in the future:
